# Who am I?
21 Random french person who got interested in design in 2014, have been self-learning most since then. Got interested in front-end developpement in 2016 and in back-end developpement in 2019. 

Currently doing my second year/3 for my front / motion / design qualification in a sandwich training.

Most of my pro. repos are private but you can still check my public personal works on my orgs or here on my profile. I really like open-source and I kinda want to release some open-source tools in the future like a self-hosted portfolio manager, a python front-end (material) framework and some other stuff.

# Mid-Level Front-End Developper
I do front-end stuff so I use front end stuff :
- HTML/CSS/JS Vanilla
- I like [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
- I also like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 
- I prefer [Less](https://lesscss.org/) over [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- And [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- But my favorite is [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- I know [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) even if I don't like (hate) them
  
 
I also do UI / UX Designer mainly using Xd / Ae. I only works in vector graphics, I mainly draw vectors in Illustrator and I use all the adobe suite for general-design  purposes

# Junior Back-End Developper

Yes, as a back-end dev I've used some back-end technologies since 2019 :
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Drone](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/) / [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (SoonTM)
  
  
# Favorite Stack
  
I like to split my back and my front into these:
  
  Back:
  - Django as a REST API using DRF
  - PostgreSQL
  
  Front:
  - Vuejs
  - Less
  - Vite for the build even tho I'm getting into Astro rn

  Ops:
  - Docker
  - Drone/Action pipeline for continuous integrations
  - (I must learn how to use it) K8s
  
  
# What's next?
Aside back or front or anything I want to have fun with :
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
