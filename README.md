# Who am I?
25 Random french that got interested in design in 2014, have been self-learning most since then (thanks school for not learning me stuff). Got interested in front-end developement in 2016 and in back-end developement in 2019. I worked a lot to be proud to say I'm a FullStack Developer (and MUX designer), and not a JS dev (sorry but for me Express isn't back end)

Most of my pro. repos are private but you can still check my public personal works on my orgs or here on my profile, I currently work for [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com)  as a developer and maintainer for their web services. 
  
# Techs i like

I've worked with most mainstream techs (except php because i like my life) but nowadays I'm mainly a Django nerd and i reaaaaaally prefer to work on backend stuff (except php), i have basic understandings of K8s and Docker and the stack i like to do for back is simply Django / Django / Django, but more seriously Django / Celery for tasks and async / Redis + PSQL for pstorage etc. As for the frontend side, i rly like Nuxt and Vue which is for me the best js/ts framework out there, Nuxt is cool but can be a bit overwhelming, when you get how it works it make development easier especially with the amount of QoL features it bundles. I usualy make Rest APIs to interact with a Vue/Nuxt front. I'd like to dive more in stuff like Go or Rust in the future but that doesn't really lines up with my current job so later ig!
