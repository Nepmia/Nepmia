# Who am I?
21 Random french person who got interested in design in 2014, have been self-learning most since then (thanks school for not learning me stuff). Got interested in front-end developement in 2016 and in back-end developement in 2019. 

Most of my pro. repos are private but you can still check my public personal works on my orgs or here on my profile, tho I currently work for [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com)  as a developer and maintainer for their web services. 

I really like open-source and I kinda want to release some open-source tools in the future, but I have no time to do it for now :(.

# Mid-Level Front-End Developer (sooon Senior)
Techs I use :
- HTML/CSS/JS Vanilla
- I like [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
- I also like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 
- I prefer [Less](https://lesscss.org/) over [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- And [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- But my favorite is [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- I know [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) even if I don't like (extremely hate) them
  
 
I also do UI / UX Designer mainly using Xd / Ae. I only works in vector graphics, I mainly draw vectors in Illustrator and I use all the adobe suite for general-design  purposes

# Junior Back-End Developer

Techs I use :
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)

# Favorite Stack
  
I really like to split everything into scallable parts, so I basically do JAMStacks
  
  Back:
  - Django as a REST API using DRF
  - PostgreSQL
  
  Front:
  - Vuejs
  - Less
  - Vite for the build even tho I'm getting into Astro rn

Deployment is made using docker and I sometimes set up CIs when needed (Drone CI), but I'd like to use more Actions from github and gitlab CIs, I also would like to run stuff under my own K8s (not someone's one) 
  
  
# What's next?
Aside back or front or anything I want to have fun with :
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/), **NO, i'm joking ofc**

- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html)
