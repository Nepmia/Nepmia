# Junior Front-End Dev but I like back end more.
Also I use these languages :
- Python (a language for the front-end devs, the real ones)
- JS + JQUERY (Someone once told me that jQuery was archaic but it ain't dumb if it works right?)
- Less (I won't even say I do css)
- HTML (Do I even need to list it here? We're talking about languages no?)  
     
I'm kinda interested in evolving into a fullstack dev so I'm also interested in these:
- TS (Not TeamSpeak, I use discord, also this is TypeScript)
- Go (Let's go, everyone made the joke already)
- Rust (Why use Rust? Especially when you can use Rouille https://github.com/bnjbvr/rouille)
- C / C++ / c# (ptdr c ki? < Only French from Fronce can understand)
