# Who am I?
21 Random french person who got interested in design in 2014, have been self-learning most since then. Got interested in front-end developpement in 2016 and in back-end developpement in 2019. 

Currently doing my second year/3 for my front / motion / design qualification in a sandwich training. Planning to do a backend school after this.

Most of my pro. repos are private but you can still check my public personal works on my orgs or here on my profile. I really like open-source and I kinda want to release some open-source tools in the future like a self-hoster portfolio manager, a python front-end (material) framework and some other stuff.

MIT For ever.
# Junior Front-End Developper
I'm currently a front-end dev and so I use front end stuff :
- HTML/CSS/JS Vanilla
- I like [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
- I also like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- I really like [Less](https://lesscss.org/) 
- And [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- But my favorite is [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- I know [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) even if I don't like them
  
I'm also a skilled UI / UX Designer mainly using Xd / Ae. I only works in vector graphics and mainly draw vectors in Illustrator and I use all the adobe suite for general-design  purposes
# And what about Back-End?

Yes, since 2019 I got very interested in backend, I even plan to do some backend school at some point to be a fullstack dev. I've used some languages and back-end technologies since 2019 :
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Drone](https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/) / [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (SoonTM)
  
  
# What's next?
Aside back or front or anything I want to have fun with :
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/), **NO, i'm joking ofc**
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- And many more actually
